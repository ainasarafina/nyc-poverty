    <p>The Lower East Side have recently been facing challenges of indirect displacement as luxury developers are in the process of starting construction of four megatowers that are planned to be built at the East River Waterfront at Two Bridges, where many working-class communities of color still reside today. “You put in luxury buildings to change the complete fabric of the neighborhood overnight,” said Trever Holland, resident of Two Bridges and president of the Tenants Union Fighting For Lower East Side (TUFF-LES).

    <p>Neighborhoods like Two Bridges that consist of immigrants from Europe, Latin America, China and many more represents the diversity of New York City. However, according to NYU Furman Center even the most diverse boroughs are also the poorest. Higher poverty rates could also indicate gentrification that many black and brown neighborhoods are facing today.
